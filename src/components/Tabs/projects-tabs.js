        Hi! I&apos;m a digital marketing executive turned full-stack developer
        in training. My background in marketing has given me a strong foundation
        in understanding user experience, journeys, and site design which I aim
        to apply in all my projects.
        <p>
          <br /> Outside of coding, you&apos;ll likely find me in the local
          tabletop gaming stores and waxing-lyrical about Pok√©mon, or taking
          part in roleplaying games as both a player and dungeon-master!
          <p>
