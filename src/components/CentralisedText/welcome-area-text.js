          We&apos;re Corinna & Steph, two aspiring full-stack developers
          currently studying at Tech Educators. This site is our collaborative
          week 10 project, which is built with Ant Design, a component library
          that allows for clean layouts that makes for a great transition for
          users going between prebuilt or drag and drop website builders into
          more of a full development environment.{" "}

          Here you&apos;ll find a collection of our individual and joint
          projects, highlighting our journey as developers and the skills we’ve
          been building along the way. From creative front-end interfaces to
          full-stack applications, each project reflects our growth, curiosity,
          and love for code.
